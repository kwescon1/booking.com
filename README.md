# Project: Simulating Booking.com with Laravel

In this long course, I have decided to simulate the creation of a well-known web application, Booking.com, using the Laravel framework. The aim of this project is to gain practical experience by creating a simplified version of the application, focusing on specific components. The scope of the project is as follows:

## Project Scope

I will be working on the following aspects of the project:

-   Database Structure: I will design and implement the necessary database structure to support the management of properties, property search functionality, displaying apartments/rooms data, and enabling the booking process.

-   API Endpoints: Using Laravel, I will create robust API endpoints for handling various operations. This includes managing properties, implementing property search functionality, retrieving and displaying apartment/room information, and facilitating the booking process.

-   Automated Testing: To ensure the reliability and correctness of the implemented functionality, I will cover all aspects of the project with automated tests using PHPUnit.

## Course Objectives

By undertaking this project, I aim to achieve the following objectives:

-   Gain practical experience in developing web applications using Laravel and implementing features specific to the Booking.com domain.

-   Learn how to design and implement a well-structured database to manage properties, perform property searches, display apartment/room data, and handle bookings.

-   Acquire proficiency in creating robust API endpoints using Laravel, allowing seamless interaction with the application's functionality.

-   Understand the importance of automated testing and demonstrate the ability to write effective tests using PHPUnit.

## Good luck with your coding endeavors!

I am excited to embark on this project and learn valuable skills in web application development with Laravel. By simulating the creation of Booking.com, I will gain practical experience in building a real-world application and expand my knowledge of Laravel's capabilities.

Wishing myself the best of luck on this coding journey!
